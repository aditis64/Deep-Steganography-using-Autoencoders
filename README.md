# Deep-Steganography-using-Autoencoders

The key idea here is to create a model, that is, the architecture and weights that can transform any image into its corresponding latent space, a visually similar form of the image that occupies far less memory than the original. This latent space serves as an encrypted form of the image and can be transmitted to the other party via any public channel. On the other side, the user should have the decoder model for the corresponding encoder, which, in the case of this project, is symmetric and the exact opposite of the encoder model.The methodology used in this project involves the implementation of an autoencoder via a convolutional neural network(CNN) with the help of the keras and tensorflow libraries in python, to a large image dataset.
